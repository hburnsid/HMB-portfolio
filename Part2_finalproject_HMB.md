# Final Project Part 2
## Storyboard Outline
### Background
I will begin my presentation with an overview of police brutality and body cameras. 

In recent years there has been a number of senseless fatal shootings by police, which has spurred movements for police reform across the country through groups such as Black Lives Matter. These reforms looked to find ways to hold police officers accountable and methods to prevent killings by the police. After the killing of Micheal Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the rise of personal footage to hold police accountable, many activists and policymakers pushed for the implementation of body cameras. 

Body cameras, or bodycams, refer to a recording device that captures video and audio worn on the body of the police officer to record the daily events of an officer on duty.  Bodycams were introduced as an iron-clad way to hold police accountable, as footage would prove if an officer acted in accordance with the law or if they acted improperly, requiring legal action against the officer.

### Usage and Public Approval

Then I will have a section about the implementation of bodycams in the U.S. and public opinion about them.
I will show a screen with this image that says in large text,  nearly half of the countryâ€™s local police departments were using body cameras. And as you continue to scroll another line will tell you, Among departments with more than 500 full-time officers, 70 percent were using body cameras.

I will then go into visualization 1. 
This visualization shows a map of the U.S. with different colors representing different levels of funding in place and laws that exist or require body cameras.

After this I will have another image with text that scrolls over that reads, in 2017 alone, the federal government provided over $40 million dollars to police programs to invest in body cameras.

I will then show visualization 2, which shows a pie chart with public opinion of bodycams to demonstrate that across both polical parties legislators and citizens support the usage of body cameras.

### Effects
I will then go on to talk about the effectiveness of bodycams. I will start by having a blank page to scroll over that says, With all of the support and implementation for body cams, did they work? 

I will then show visualization 3, which is a stacked bar chart that shows police killings in the U.S. by race. This visualization will show that despite the implementation of bodycams, there is not a very significant decline in the number of police killings. 
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12025132"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

To add on to this point, I will have a block of text that describes the review of literature on body cams and show that there has been a majortiy of research that shows that bodycams have little to no impact on reducing use of force by officers. Accompanying this text will be a visualization that shows the changes in different metrics calculated in the studies.

### Recommendations and Call to Action

For my last section I will discuss what can be done to mitigate the dissapointing effects of bodycams. I will create a sort of infographic with either photos or icons to represent eight of the most researched and recommended interventions to reduce police brutality that has the largest potential for an impact. There will be additional text appears when hovering over each tile to give a brief description of the policy. I will highlight how body cameras in theory have the potential to be incredibly impactful, but with current practices have not shown the impact that was promised. Given the high cost to purchase, maintain, and store data, other policies should be considered with a more targeted approach to using bodycams.

For my call to action, I will introduce this map that will provide a rating for each state based on the number of passed or in-progress bills that correspond to the eight recommendations. When the reader hovers over each state, a text box will indicate which legislation is in progress and which has been passed already. This map is meant to show the progress that is being made, and the work that still needs to be done. Given these resources, policymakers have actionable tasks for their respective states.

## User Feedback

### Target Audience
I intend to interview other prospective policymakers and people who have experience in policy-adjacent fields. I am interested in these opinions as this is my target audience for my presentation and I want to be sure that they can read it and understand what to do afterwards in their own work and recommend policies to colleagues. 

### Identifying Approach
To find the right people, I decided to talk to policymakers in the field, other classmates who are prospective policymakers, or professionals that work in similar fields. I also wanted to choose people that had some cursory knowledge of the issue but did not have experience working in police related policy reform so the information would have the most impact. 

### Interview Script
1. For each visualization tell me what you see and if there are any areas of confusion.
2. Was this information something you had not previously encountered? 
3. What is something you want clarification on or wish there was more detail about?
4. Who do you believe is the target audience for this presentation?

***Young Professional, 26***
The fist respondant felt that overall the visualizations were easy to read and very straight forward. She felt that each type of visualization made sense in the context used and did not have difficulty understanding the information they were conveying. For the stacked bar chart depicting deaths she felt that the colors may be too close as she had some trouble telling the different races apart. She also wanted to know why the demographic information was included and spent some time trying to understand that. 

She felt that she had a good sense of the issue and was not generally suprised by the overall findings. She was surprised at how much funding went into bodycams, she said she felt enraged seeing the figure. 

She felt that she didn't need any clarificaton, but wanted to know more information about why exactly bodycams are not working. She wanted to see what about them or the system at large made them fail as an intervention. 

When asked about the target audience, she believed that this information was intended for voting-age constituents to inform them about the failures associated with bodycams. 

***policymaker, 35***
The second respondent felt that some of the colors may be difficult to see for colorblind users and that if the visualizations were reprpoduced in black and white they would be diffifuclt to see. She liked the organizational structure of the visualizations and felt they were logical. She mentioned that she didn't like pie charts in general, and that this one was not providing much information, especially since she already knew that most people supported body cams. She liked the call to action aesthetics and felt that it would be good for someone who skimmed. 

This respondent was also surprised by the amount of money spent on funding for bodycams. She was also interested in seeing the breakdown of demographics of police killings to see how they had changed over time. 

On further inspection, she realized the high number of deaths with the demogrpahics "unknown" and "other" and wanted to know what that meant and why they weren't assigned a race. She also felt that for the last map in the call to action section that the title should be changed to refelt something more proactive for policymakers. 

She also agreed that the audience for this presentation was an average voter, but added that this would be very helpful for policymakers as well. 

***prospective policymaker, 23***
The last respondant said tht some of the titles needed work with redundancy, like repeating the word police force. She also wanted more context on labeling for some of the visualization like adding more information about the funding map and adding the word death to the stacked bar chart to make the graph have a more human element. She also warned of using colors that were too close together and too dark, as they were hard to tell apart. 

This respondent was surprised that body cameras had shown reducting in injury, but overall was not shocked by the information in the rest of the presentation. 

For the pie chart, she recommended adding the percentages to each proportion. She wanted some more information related to the number of injuries decreasing with the implementation of body cams. Because she felt this was surprising she wanted to know what the literature speculated was the reason for this occurring. 

She felt that the intended audience would be the general public and policymakers, both to inform them on the issue at hand. 

## Next Steps

After getting this feedback, I plan on implementing a good amount of the critiques. I'm going to remove the demographics of the stacked bar chart because I feel the information was not adding to the overall takeaway, which is that deaths have remained the same over the years. The color scheme I used and the missing data points distracted from the overall message. I will also add the data points for the before/after implementation bar chart, but leave them out for the pie chart, as I feel they are not relevant to understaning the point, especially because it seems like many people are aware of this information. For the last map, I will include more specific langauge targted at policyakers to make it know that the information is supposed to be used by them. I will also refine my titles and color schemes.
