# Final Project Part 2
## Storyboard Outline
### Background
I will begin my presentation with an overview of police brutality and body cameras. 

In recent years there has been a number of senseless fatal shootings by police, which has spurred movements for police reform across the country through groups such as Black Lives Matter. These reforms looked to find ways to hold police officers accountable and methods to prevent killings by the police. After the killing of Micheal Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the rise of personal footage to hold police accountable, many activists and policymakers pushed for the implementation of body cameras. 

Body cameras, or bodycams, refer to a recording device that captures video and audio worn on the body of the police officer to record the daily events of an officer on duty.  Bodycams were introduced as an iron-clad way to hold police accountable, as footage would prove if an officer acted in accordance with the law or if they acted improperly, requiring legal action against the officer.

### Usage and Public Approval

Then I will have a section about the implementation of bodycams in the U.S. and public opinion about them.
I will show a screen with this image that says in large text,  nearly half of the countryâ€™s local police departments were using body cameras. And as you continue to scroll another line will tell you, Among departments with more than 500 full-time officers, 70 percent were using body cameras.

I will then go into visualization 1. 
This visualization shows a map of the U.S. with different colors representing different levels of funding in place and laws that exist or require body cameras.

After this I will have another image with text that scrolls over that reads, in 2017 alone, the federal government provided over $40 million dollars to police programs to invest in body cameras.

I will then show visualization 2, which shows a pie chart with public opinion of bodycams to demonstrate that across both polical parties legislators and citizens support the usage of body cameras.

### Effects
I will then go on to talk about the effectiveness of bodycams. I will start by having a blank page to scroll over that says, With all of the support and implementation for body cams, did they work? 

I will then show visualization 3, which is a stacked bar chart that shows police killings in the U.S. by race. This visualization will show that despite the implementation of bodycams, there is not a very significant decline in the number of police killings.

To add on to this point, I will have a block of text that describes the review of literature on body cams and show that there has been a majortiy of research that shows that bodycams have little to no impact on reducing use of force by officers. Accompanying this text will be a visualization that shows the changes in different metrics calculated in the studies.

### Recommendations and Call to Action

For my last section I will discuss what can be done to mitigate the dissapointing effects of bodycams. I will create a sort of infographic with either photos or icons to represent eight of the most researched and recommended interventions to reduce police brutality that has the largest potential for an impact. There will be additional text appears when hovering over each tile to give a brief description of the policy. I will highlight how body cameras in theory have the potential to be incredibly impactful, but with current practices have not shown the impact that was promised. Given the high cost to purchase, maintain, and store data, other policies should be considered with a more targeted approach to using bodycams.

For my call to action, I will introduce this map that will provide a rating for each state based on the number of passed or in-progress bills that correspond to the eight recommendations. When the reader hovers over each state, a text box will indicate which legislation is in progress and which has been passed already. This map is meant to show the progress that is being made, and the work that still needs to be done. Given these resources, policymakers have actionable tasks for their respective states.
