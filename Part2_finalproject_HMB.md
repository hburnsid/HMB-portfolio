# Final Project Part 2
## Storyboard Outline
### Background
I will begin my presentation with an overview of police brutality and body cameras. 

In recent years there has been a number of senseless fatal shootings by police, which has spurred movements for police reform across the country through groups such as Black Lives Matter. These reforms looked to find ways to hold police officers accountable and methods to prevent killings by the police. After the killing of Micheal Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the rise of personal footage to hold police accountable, many activists and policymakers pushed for the implementation of body cameras. 

Body cameras, or bodycams, refer to a recording device that captures video and audio worn on the body of the police officer to record the daily events of an officer on duty.  Bodycams were introduced as an iron-clad way to hold police accountable, as footage would prove if an officer acted in accordance with the law or if they acted improperly, requiring legal action against the officer.

### Usage and Public Approval

Then I will have a section about the implementation of bodycams in the U.S. and public opinion about them.
I will show a screen with this image that says in large text,  nearly half of the countryâ€™s local police departments were using body cameras. And as you continue to scroll another line will tell you, Among departments with more than 500 full-time officers, 70 percent were using body cameras.

I will then go into visualization 1. 
This visualization shows a map of the U.S. with different colors representing different levels of funding in place and laws that exist or require body cameras. 

After this I will have another image with text that scrolls over that reads, in 2017 alone, the federal government provided over $40 million dollars to police programs to invest in body cameras.

I will then show visualization 2, which shows a pie chart with public opinion of bodycams to demonstrate that across both polical parties legislators and citizens support the usage of body cameras.
