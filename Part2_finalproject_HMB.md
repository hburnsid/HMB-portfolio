## Storyboard Outline
###Background
I will begin my presentation with an overview of police brutality and body cameras. 

In recent years there has been a number of senseless fatal shootings by police, which has spurred movements for police reform across the country through groups such as Black Lives Matter. These reforms looked to find ways to hold police officers accountable and methods to prevent killings by the police. After the killing of Micheal Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the rise of personal footage to hold police accountable, many activists and policymakers pushed for the implementation of body cameras.
