Telling Stories with Data Portfolio

# About Me
I'm a second year graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University studying public policy and management. I'm very interested in education policy as I previously worked as a museum educator, and worked to create dynamic programming to help increase equity in the museum space. I'm hoping to work at a progressive think tank where I can either conduct research or work on advocacy related projects. 

# What I hope to Learn
I'm very excited to merge my previous background of art history where I learned a great deal about aesthetics and design and with my new knowledge of data analysis to create more effective and enganging data visualizations. I've found that many organizations would love to implement more data into their work and utilizing visualizations is a great tool to further push those initiatives. I'm also looking forward to learning certain programs like Tableau and Github as I've seen others using them and have not had the chance to do so.
