# Part I: Final Project 

## Story Outline

### Summary
Despite increased awareness, attention, and policies related to police brutality, there has been little progress made in reducing the number of deaths caused by police. To demonstrate this, I will give a brief history and snapshot of the current state of the issue, discuss a few of the major movements and polcies that have been implemented, and present the impacts. I would like to cover policies such as body cameras, defunding the police efforts, community representation programs, and trainging programs. I will demonstrate how these polcies were well intentioned, and in some cases well-funded, but ultimately have not contributed to a reducting in wrongful deaths and vicious assults. 

### Story Arc
As illustrated in my project structure, I would like to start the presentation by presenting the assumptions that have been displayed prominately on the news, especially the uprising that began after defund the police was introduced in Minneapolis after the death of George Floyd. I will then explain the issue in more general terms by demonstrating trends in policy brutality and who is diproportionately affected. I will then discuss the lack of impacts of some of these policy interventions and stress how continuing to implement policies like body cameras will not protect citizens. Lastly, I will introduce policies that should be implemented that have a great deal of potential to reduce police brutality.

## Initial Sketches

This first sketch illustrates the first part of my story arc, which demonstrates how police officers are deadly and the incident rates. Prior to these first two sketches, I would like to have some images of protests related to defund the police and other policies as well as statistics that express public opinion around police brutality.

This second visualization breaks down the general trends over time with police brutality, highlighting the different types of force that are utilized. This graph will be used to highlight the issue at hand before specifying existing policies.

Next, I will move on to the next section of the presentation which discusses the current policies and how these policies have not lived up to expectations of those who promoted them and did not cause the chaos and negative effects that those who opposed them predicted. In this visualization, I'm showing a comparison of different major cities and the amount of budgetary change that occured after the defund the police campaign. This graph highlights that most cities actually increased their funding for police departments and only a few made any kind of sizable reduction in the quest to defund their police department. I may also include a visualization about how these particular police departments changed their budgets and the impact of these changes.

Along with the last visualization, I have a chart that shows the effects of bodycams. Most people believe that they are a tried and true policy that greatly reduces the level of violence perpetrated by the police. The data suggests, however, that body cams have not had the effect that they were intended. The number of deaths, which are the highest priorty to policy makers has remained stagnant.I would like to include more polcies other than body cameras and defund the police efforts if possible.

The last section of my story arc provides recommendations for better policy interventions. I will create a sort of infographic with either photos or icons to represent eight of the most researched and recommended interventions to reduce police brutality that have the largest potential for an impact. There will be additional text appears when hovering over each tile to give a brief description of the policy.

For my call to action, I will introduce this map that will provide a rating for each state based on the number of passed or in progress bills that correspond to the eight recommendations. When the reader hovers over each state a text box will indicate which legislation is in progress and which has been passed already. This map is meant to show the progress that is being made, and the work that still needs to be done. Given these resources, policymakers have actionable tasks for their respective states.
