## Story Outline

### Summary
Although increased awareness, attention, and policies related to police brutality, there has been little progress in reducing the number of deaths caused by police. To demonstrate this, I will give a brief history and snapshot of the current state of the issue, discuss a few of the major movements and policies that have been implemented, and present the impacts. I want to cover policies such as body cameras, defunding police efforts, community representation programs, and training programs. I will demonstrate how these policies were well-intentioned and, in some cases, well-funded but ultimately have not contributed to reducing wrongful deaths and vicious assaults.

### Story Arc
As illustrated in my project structure, I would like to start the presentation by presenting the assumptions that have been displayed prominently on the news, especially the uprising that began after defunding the police was introduced in Minneapolis after the death of George Floyd. I will then explain the issue in more general terms by demonstrating trends in policy brutality and who is disproportionately affected. I will then discuss the lack of impacts of some of these policy interventions and stress how continuing to implement policies like body cameras will not protect citizens. Lastly, I will introduce policies that should be implemented that have a great deal of potential to reduce police brutality.

## Initial Sketches

This first sketch illustrates the first part of my story arc, which demonstrates how police officers are deadly and the incident rates. Prior to these first two sketches, I would like to have some images of protests related to defund the police and other policies, as well as statistics that express public opinion around police brutality.

This second visualization breaks down the general trends over time with police brutality, highlighting the different types of force that are utilized. This graph will be used to highlight the issue at hand before specifying existing policies.

Next, I will move on to the next section of the presentation, which discusses the current policies and how they have not lived up to the expectations of those who promoted them and did not cause the chaos and adverse effects that those who opposed them predicted. In this visualization, I'm comparing different major cities and the amount of budgetary change that occurred after the defund the police campaign. This graph highlights that most cities increased their funding for police departments, and only a few made any sizable reduction in the quest to defund their police department. I may also include a visualization about how these particular police departments changed their budgets and the impact of these changes.

Along with the last visualization, I have a chart showing bodycams' effects. Most people believe that they are a tried and true policy that greatly reduces the level of violence perpetrated by the police. The data suggest that body cams have not had the intended effect. The number of deaths, which is policymakers' highest priority, has remained stagnant. I would like to include more policies other than body cameras and defund the police efforts if possible.

The last section of my story arc provides recommendations for better policy interventions. I will create a sort of infographic with either photos or icons to represent eight of the most researched and recommended interventions to reduce police brutality that has the largest potential for an impact. There will be additional text appears when hovering over each tile to give a brief description of the policy.

For my call to action, I will introduce this map that will provide a rating for each state based on the number of passed or in-progress bills that correspond to the eight recommendations. When the reader hovers over each state, a text box will indicate which legislation is in progress and which has been passed already. This map is meant to show the progress that is being made, and the work that still needs to be done. Given these resources, policymakers have actionable tasks for their respective states.

## Data 

For this project, I will utilize data from the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF). PERF is a nonprofit association conducting research on police and policy organizations. They produce reports on best practices and strategies for better policing techniques. I will also utilize the recommendations and data collected by Campaign Zero. Their mission is to improve policing techniques to live in a world where the police cause no deaths. They were originally created in 2015 after the protests in Ferguson, Baltimore. Lastly, I will utilize the data collected by Mapping Police Violence. This project created a database that estimates it has captured 92% of police killings since 2013. I am still looking for sources that can best identify other uses of police force that did not result in death.   

## Method and Medium

For this project, I will utilize shorthand to combine my data visualizations, images, and statistics to help tell the story. I hope to explore more with Tableau for my visualizations, and may attempt to use Esriâ€™s StoryMaps to create my map sketch.
