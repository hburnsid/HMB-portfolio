# Part I: Final Project 

## Story Outline

### Summary
Despite increased awareness, attention, and policies related to police brutality, there has been little progress made in reducing the number of deaths caused by police. To demonstrate this, I will give a brief history and snapshot of the current state of the issue, discuss a few of the major movements and polcies that have been implemented, and present the impacts. I would like to cover policies such as body cameras, defunding the police efforts, community representation programs, and trainging programs. I will demonstrate how these polcies were well intentioned, and in some cases well-funded, but ultimately have not contributed to a reducting in wrongful deaths and vicious assults. 

### Story Arc
As illustrated in my project structure, I would like to start the presentation by presenting the assumptions that have been displayed prominately on the news, especially the uprising that began after defund the police was introduced in Minneapolis after the death of George Floyd. I will then explain the issue in more general terms by demonstrating trends in policy brutality and who is diproportionately affected. I will then discuss the lack of impacts of some of these policy interventions and stress how continuing to implement policies like body cameras will not protect citizens. Lastly, I will introduce policies that should be implemented that have a great deal of potential to reduce police brutality.
