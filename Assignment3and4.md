# Assignment 3 and 4: Critique By Design

## Step 1: find a data visualization

For this assignment I was interested in picking a topic that would be related to economic trends and found a wealth of data visualizations about GDP as there is a considerable amount of data collected on this. I liked the idea of examining the different ways that GDP can be compared, between countries, regions, and at a global scale. This visualization created by HowMuch.net, a financial literacy website, uses data from the World Bank to create its visualization.

## Step 2: Critique the visualization

After assigning different visual and storytelling elements of the visualization, I used these questions to help guide my critique. 

***Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here.  What stood out to you?  What did you find worked really well?  What didn't?  What, if anything, would you do differently?***

The data visualization is extremely cluttered and visually demanding. When I first looked at the visualization, I was overwhelmed by the amount of color used in the chart to describe the different regions. I was also drawn to the United States in the visualization because the text for that section was the largest, and the color used was brighter than the others, which stood out. The shapes used for each country also stood out to me because at first, I thought the visualization was a pie chart, but then I realized that it was actually a kind of bubble chart, where the different shapes represented the size of the world GDP. 

I think bringing the different countries close together was slightly useful for making a simple side-by-side comparison. Coupled with the use of color to distinguish regions, a high-level analysis isn't terribly difficult to understand, but when looking closer at the visualization, it becomes clear that any real comparisons and analysis would be incorrect because the data have been misrepresented visually. 

There are many elements that do not work with this visualization. The first is the organization of the data. Forcing every country into a circle is unnecessary and confusing to the reader as they have to determine what is happening with the different shapes. Furthermore, the text of many countries with smaller GDPs is very hard to read because the font size is inconsistent to fit each shape into the circle. There are more inconsistencies with the shapes as they are irregular and do not actually correspond to the amount of GDP. For example, the Philippines and Pakistan are essentially the same proportion of GDP (0.39% and 0.38%, respectively) but are different shapes with seemingly different areas. The irregular shapes make it impossible to truly compare within regions or across different regions. It is also very difficult to rank the top 10 countries as after a certain percentage of GDP, most of the top-ranking countries do not stand out from the smaller countries. This format also gives a truncated picture as there are many countries that are left out and would contribute to the overall size of the regional GDP designations with the use of "other countries" that encompasses many countries from all regions. After working with the data, I also noticed that many countries are not listed, which is misleading from the title of the chart, and that the data does not equal 100% of all GDP.


***Who is the primary audience for this tool?  Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience?  Why or why not?***

The website I found this visualization on states that its content is intended to help individuals make better financial decisions meaning that its broad audience is. This visualization is not particularly useful for this audience because while it gives a quick snapshot of what is going on globally, it is very difficult to compare or analyze and is irrelevant to personal financial decisions. Because the average person may not know what to look for when comparing GDP, a better title and more analysis in the visualization would have been more useful than just showing the data and not guiding the reader. 

I assumed that this tool's audience would be someone interested in global economies and studying the differences in country GDPs. If this were the case, the visualization could be useful to policymakers, government workers, or economists who would need access to this data quickly. I believe the visualization is providing a quick snapshot of who the top players are, but the people who would actually use this data would probably need something clearer and more in-depth. 


***Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here?  What would you change?  Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.)***

I liked the use of a sliding scale for some of the measurements because they allowed me to assign a numerical score to something that is often intangible. It allowed me to center my thoughts before further explaining them. I would add a section that critiques story telling ability of the visualization and expand further on the engagement section because the two ends of the spectrum are a little confusing when coupled with engagement. 

## Step 3: Sketch out a solution

For my sketches I wanted to simplify the overall look of the originial visualization and focus on the narrative of which countries and which regions were leading in world GDP rates. I struggled with combining these ideas into one graph so I decided to seperate the ideas, since it became very cluttered when I had them all together. Overall, I wanted to reduce the amount of color used and create visualizations that would allow for easy comparisons. Initially, I felt that in the end I would choose just one visualization to complete for this assignment. 

### Sketch 1: 
For my first sketch I wanted to use something that would capture the overall feeling of the orginal visualization, so I chose to use a tree map. I felt that this would simplify the regional comparisons in the original, while still allowing for a quick and easy understanding of who the global leaders were. The original visualization was similar to a tree map, but the use of irregular shapes and the overall circle shape was not useful for creating accurate comparisons. I felt that the tree map could capture the essence of the first visualization, but mitigate the issues discussed previously. I realzied that the regional names used in the original were not very useful or descriptive as Asia is a very large region, so I noted internally that I would have to change them. I wanted to use a gradient for the colors to show the higher GDP countries with one end of the spectrum with blues, and smaller GDP countries with oranges. I felt that blues were logical as they were more saturated and are commonly used to designate better things than oranges or red, in this case smaller GDP. I also decided I wanted to remove some of the regions and only focus on the largest, as I felt that it would reduce the cognitive burden while focusing on the important elements of the chart, i.e., who are the leaders. The box underneath signifies the tab that would show detailed information on the region when the mouse hovers over that region.

### Sketch 2:
For my second sketch, I strayed away from the original message of the chart by showing which individual countries had the highest GDP. This information along with the color coded regions together created a messy picture that was difficult to understand for a reader. I chose to create two sketches because I wanted to see which sketch would impart the most amount of useful information. I thought that with a general audience, they would not be interested in knowing the GDP of very small countries and after the top 10 countries there was a massive gap between the rest of the 200 countries, even the rest of the countries shown on the original visualization. I felt then that showing just a few countries would be the most useful. With the title, "The U.S. Leads the World in GDP" I wanted to call attention to the stark difference in GDP, which is why I also chose to color the U.S. blue (logical with our flag) and the other countries gray to still get the reader to compare the countries in different regions, but to notice how much farther ahead the U.S. really is. I chose to use actual dollar amounts in this graph to give a better sense of what it means to be in the top 10 countries and allowed for the hovered tab to show what the percentage is for that individual country as well.

## Step 4: Test the Solution

To gain outside feedback on my initial solutions, I asked two people to provide criticism that would be useful for going into the final step. 

***Student, early 20's***
I tried my best not to guide the conversation too much, but started by showing her the original visualization and then the two sketches that I had created. She discussed how she was more visually drawn to the tree map, as it was a more unusual way to visulize the data and she enjoyed looking at it more than a bar graph, which she had encounted many times previously and did not feel engaged when looking at it. She also mentioned that it was a good idea to use just the top ten countries for my bar graph if I took that route because it was clearer and more simple to understand. She also added that she felt that both visualizations were clear to her and that she felt that she could discern the idea I was trying to convey when we discussed it after her inital thoughts. We also discussed figuing out a way to incorporate the top countries for each region in the tree map so it would be understood just how much of the overall GDP was being driven by the U.S.--which would be lost using my sketch. 

***Adult, early 30's***
For this critique, I utilized the questions provided by our professor as this person was not as comfortable with data visualizations. When asked about the meaning of the graph he correctly assumed that both of the graphs were telling the story of characterizing GDP of the world, but wondered how the different countries were being grouped. He struggled to understand if it was continents and why certain continents were left out, or if it was by region. He understood through my sketches that the U.S. is dominating world GDP and that this was the main takeaway from the visualizations. We talked more about how to improve the different regions that were included or perhaps to just explain that the visualization is grouped into regions. He felt that the bar chart was more straight forward, but also enjoyed the tree map more, but was looking for some extra clarification on how things were grouped. 

## Step 5: Build a Solution

After getting these critiques, I decided to create two visualizations that would be used in tandem to describe the different types of comparions decribed above, rather than picking one visualization over the other. I felt that these two together would produce the best understanding of the data and would be the most visually engaging and easy to understand. 

For this fist visulization I chose to slightly modify my original design. I switched the direction of the bars, as I thought it was easier to understand and visually more interesting to look at. I kept the color theme the same but chose to use red as it made sense with both the U.S. and China. I decided to also highlight China with a less saturated red hue to show the top two countries, as these two were by far the closest compared to any other country, but to maintain that they were different. I kept the usage of the top 10 countries because this was recieved well in my critiques. I chose to use percentage of GDP rather than dollar amounts as I felt that it would connect it with the second visualization that I made, as the tree map also uses percentages. If the reader hovers over each bar I chose to include the dollar amount, but chose to write out the full amount rather than the amount in millions that is used in the orginal visualzation. While seeing a value in the trillions of dollars may make the reader pause to decipher how big the value is, I felt that it was a way to show the magnitude of difference between the countries. I also chose to add a more descriptive title and subtitle as I felt that they would better explain the main story of the data.

  </object></div>                
  <script type='text/javascript'>                    
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1668638287814');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>


For my second visualization, I chose to utilize the tree map that I orginally drew but made some changes. I started by changing the title and subtitle to correspond with the first visualization and tie them together with a stronger narrative. This showed how the U.S. alone is a powerhouse, but when grouped together with other regions, other regions are competitive with North America. I also realized this once I created my actual tree map, because when I was looking at the original visualization from HowMuch.net, I was mislead into thinking that North America was by and large the most dominant region. So when I realized the data suggested a different story, I decided to include a more appropriate subtitle that focused on this important understanding. I also made sure to include the word region in the title to incorporate the feedback from my critique. I also chose to manipulate the data and update the regions to be more useful and nuanced compared to the original regions provided. I also decided to change the color scheme from my sketch to visually tie the two visualizations together. I also struggled with finding the right hues of orange and blue and found that picking one color to range between was much easier and less visually demanding. While I wanted to include the top countries in each regions from my critique, I could not find a way to do this in flourish and had to settle for just GPD percentage alone.
