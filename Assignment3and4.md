# Assignment 3 and 4: Critique By Design

## Step 1: find a data visualization

For this assignment I was interested in picking a topic that would be related to economic trends and found a wealth of data visualizations about GDP as there is a considerable amount of data collected on this. I liked the idea of examining the different ways that GDP can be compared, between countries, regions, and at a global scale. This visualization created by HowMuch.net, a financial literacy website, uses data from the World Bank to create its visualization.

## Step 2: Critique the visualization

After assigning different visual and storytelling elements of the visualization, I used these questions to help guide my critique. 

***Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here.  What stood out to you?  What did you find worked really well?  What didn't?  What, if anything, would you do differently?***

The data visualization is extremely cluttered and visually demanding. When I first looked at the visualization, I was overwhelmed by the amount of color used in the chart to describe the different regions. I was also drawn to the United States in the visualization because the text for that section was the largest, and the color used was brighter than the others, which stood out. The shapes used for each country also stood out to me because at first, I thought the visualization was a pie chart, but then I realized that it was actually a kind of bubble chart, where the different shapes represented the size of the world GDP. 

I think bringing the different countries close together was slightly useful for making a simple side-by-side comparison. Coupled with the use of color to distinguish regions, a high-level analysis isn't terribly difficult to understand, but when looking closer at the visualization, it becomes clear that any real comparisons and analysis would be incorrect because the data have been misrepresented visually. 

There are many elements that do not work with this visualization. The first is the organization of the data. Forcing every country into a circle is unnecessary and confusing to the reader as they have to determine what is happening with the different shapes. Furthermore, the text of many countries with smaller GDPs is very hard to read because the font size is inconsistent to fit each shape into the circle. There are more inconsistencies with the shapes as they are irregular and do not actually correspond to the amount of GDP. For example, the Philippines and Pakistan are essentially the same proportion of GDP (0.39% and 0.38%, respectively) but are different shapes with seemingly different areas. The irregular shapes make it impossible to truly compare within regions or across different regions. It is also very difficult to rank the top 10 countries as after a certain percentage of GDP, most of the top-ranking countries do not stand out from the smaller countries. This format also gives a truncated picture as there are many countries that are left out and would contribute to the overall size of the regional GDP designations with the use of "other countries" that encompasses many countries from all regions. After working with the data, I also noticed that many countries are not listed, which is misleading from the title of the chart, and that the data does not equal 100% of all GDP.


***Who is the primary audience for this tool?  Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience?  Why or why not?***

The website I found this visualization on states that its content is intended to help individuals make better financial decisions meaning that its broad audience is. This visualization is not particularly useful for this audience because while it gives a quick snapshot of what is going on globally, it is very difficult to compare or analyze and is irrelevant to personal financial decisions. Because the average person may not know what to look for when comparing GDP, a better title and more analysis in the visualization would have been more useful than just showing the data and not guiding the reader. 

I assumed that this tool's audience would be someone interested in global economies and studying the differences in country GDPs. If this were the case, the visualization could be useful to policymakers, government workers, or economists who would need access to this data quickly. I believe the visualization is providing a quick snapshot of who the top players are, but the people who would actually use this data would probably need something clearer and more in-depth. 


***Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here?  What would you change?  Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.)***

I liked the use of a sliding scale for some of the measurements because they allowed me to assign a numerical score to something that is often intangible. It allowed me to center my thoughts before further explaining them. I would add a section that critiques story telling ability of the visualization and expand further on the engagement section because the two ends of the spectrum are a little confusing when coupled with engagement.
