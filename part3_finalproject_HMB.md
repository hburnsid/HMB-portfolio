## Implemented Changes

From my interviews and the feedback from my professor, I decided to implement the following changes. For my first visualization I chose to get rid of the yellow portion as it distracted from the overall message. For my second visualization, I chose to keep my original concept aesthetically but to make sure that the background of the map matched the dark gray background in my Shorthand story, which I did with the rest of the visualizations. I included text that described what the visualization is showing for this first map and highlighted the relevant statistics since my professor mentioned that I shouldn't make my story too text heavy. I picked imagery for my next section that relfected the story I was telling and used these slides to highlight important information relevant to implementation of body cams. For the bar graph, I took feedback from part 2 and removed the demographic divisions to highlight the fact that deaths remained flat. I also changed the color of the bars to be more cohesive with the other visualizations. I changed the structure of my infographic because I decided I wanted to have more information visiable and struggled with making the icons of my original design interactive to pull up the information. I also utilized the box outline feature of shorthand to draw the attention of the viewer to important transitional moments. Overall, I decided to focus my audience to the everyday citizen because my interviewee's felt this was this case and I felt it made the call to action more logical and actionable. In the end my call to action is now for the user to look into Campaign Zero, see where their state lands with the policies mentioned, and reach out to their local representatives.
